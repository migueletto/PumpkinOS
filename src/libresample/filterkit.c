/* LpFilter()
 *
 * reference: "Digital Filters, 2nd edition"
 *            R.W. Hamming, pp. 178-179
 *
 * Izero() computes the 0th order modified bessel function of the first kind.
 *    (Needed to compute Kaiser window).
 *
 * LpFilter() computes the coeffs of a Kaiser-windowed low pass filter with
 *    the following characteristics:
 *
 *       c[]  = array in which to store computed coeffs
 *       frq  = roll-off frequency of filter
 *       N    = Half the window length in number of coeffs
 *       Beta = parameter of Kaiser window
 *       Num  = number of coeffs before 1/frq
 *
 * Beta trades the rejection of the lowpass filter against the transition
 *    width from passband to stopband.  Larger Beta means a slower
 *    transition and greater stopband rejection.  See Rabiner and Gold
 *    (Theory and Application of DSP) under Kaiser windows for more about
 *    Beta.  The following table from Rabiner and Gold gives some feel
 *    for the effect of Beta:
 *
 * All ripples in dB, width of transition band = D*N where N = window length
 *
 *               BETA    D       PB RIP   SB RIP
