/*
	Notify Manager Events:
	
	Note that in general, for notifications regarding the creation of information
	(e.g. sysNotifyDBAddedEvent) the broadcast goes out AFTER the fact (e.g.,
	after the database has been created) and that notifications regarding
	the deletion of information are broadcast BEFORE the fact.  A notable and
	unfortunate exception to this rule is the database deleted notification, which
	is sent out after the fact.

	The sleep & wake notifications require a little special attention.  These
	notifications are _not_ guaranteed to always be broadcast, and hence are unsuitable
	for applications where external hardware must be shut off to conserve power when
	we go to sleep.  For example, the sleep notification will not be broadcast when 
	we do an emergency  shutdown due to low battery conditions.  Also note that any 
	sort of prolonged activity (especially displaying UI sich as a dialog) in response 
	to these noticfications can complicate things immensely.  UI is very tricky because 
	these notifications are broadcast from SysHandleEvent.  The result is that you may 
	receive more than one sleep notification if one of the notification clients puts up 
	a dialog or something, and it remains there long enough for another AutoOff event 
	to come through.  There are also possible problems with reentrancy and stack space 
	usage since the notification is broadcast from SysHandleEvent inside an application's 
	event loop.
