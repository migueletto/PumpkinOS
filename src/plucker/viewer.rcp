    "characters (such as 'ü') to periods.  Or you can choose to drop "\
    "accents on all Latin 1 characters, so that, for instance, a 'u-umlaut' "\
    "gets changed to a 'u'.  This also changes other non-ASCII characters "\
    "such as fancy quotation marks to their closest ASCII equivalent.  Since "\
    "your search string is also transliterated before searching, this is basically "\
